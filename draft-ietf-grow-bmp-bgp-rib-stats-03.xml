<t>
	<xref target="RFC7854"/> defines a number of different BMP statistics types to observe interesting events that occur on the router.
	Stats are either counters or gauges. A 32-bit Counter is a non-negative integer that monotonically increases
   until it reaches a maximum value, when it wraps around and starts increasing again from 0.
   A 64-bit Gauge is a non-negative integer that may increase or decrease, but shall never exceed a maximum value, nor fall below a minimum one.
</t>
<t>
   This document defines new gauges for BMP statistics message. The format of the BMP statistics message remains same as defined in <xref target="RFC7854"/>.

		Type = TBD1: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-In-Pre-Policy. 
		The value can increase or decrease based upon ongoing configuration change.
		
		Note that this counter updates stats type 7 defined in <xref target="RFC7854"/> and makes it a explicit for Adj-RIBs-In-Pre-Policy. 
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = TBD2: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI Adj-RIBs-In-Pre-Policy. 
		The value can increase or decrease based upon ongoing configuration change.
		
		Note that this counter is similar from stats type 9 defined in <xref target="RFC7854"/> and makes it a explicit for Adj-RIBs-In-Pre-Policy. 
    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = TBD3: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-In-Post-Policy. 
		The value can increase or decrease based upon ongoing configuration change.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = TBD4: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI Adj-RIBs-In-Post-Policy. 
		The value can increase or decrease based upon ongoing configuration change.
    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = TBD5: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI rejected by inbound policy. 
		The value can increase or decrease based upon ongoing configuration change.
		
		Note that this counter is different from stats type 0 defined in <xref target="RFC7854"/>. 
		The stats type 0 in <xref target="RFC7854"/> is the a 32 counter which is monotonically increasing number and 
		doesn't represents the current number of routes rejected by inbound policy due to ongoing configuration changes.
    
    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

	<t>
		Type = TBD6: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI accepted by inbound policy.
		The value can increase or decrease based upon ongoing configuration change or network events.
    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
    Some implementations, or configurations in implementations, may discard routes that do not match policy and 
    thus the accepted count and the rib-in counts will be identical in such cases.

	<t>
		Type = TBD7: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI selected as primary route. 
		The value can increase or decrease based upon ongoing configuration change or network events.
    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
    
    A primary path is a recursive or non-recursive path whose nexthop resolution ends with an adjacency <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic">draft-ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic</xref>. A
    prefix can have more than one primary path if multipath is configured <xref target="I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations">draft-lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations</xref>.
    A best-path is also considered as a primary path.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = TBD8: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI selected as backup route. 
		The value can increase or decrease based upon ongoing configuration change or network events.
    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
    
   A backup path is also installed in the RIB, but it is not used until some or all primary paths become unreachable. Backup paths are used for fast convergence in the event of failures.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = TBD9: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI suppressed by configured route damping policy. 
		The value can increase or decrease based upon configuration change or network events.
    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

    Suppressed refers to a path which has been declared suppressed by the BGP Route Flap Damping mechanism as described in Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC2439"/>.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = TBD10: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI marked as stale by any configuration.
    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

    Stale refers to a path which has been declared stale by the BGP Graceful Restart mechanism as described in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC4724"/>.

	<t>
		Type = TBD11: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI marked as stale by LLGR. 
    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
    Stale refers to a path which has been declared stale by the BGP Long-Lived Graceful Restart mechanism as described in Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC9494"/>.
    This is the route that are marked stale as part of LLGR process.

	<t>
		Type = TBD12: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes left until reaching the received route threshold as defined in Section 6.7 of <xref target="RFC4271"/>.

		Type = TBD13: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI left until reaching the received route threshold as defined in Section 6.7 of <xref target="RFC4271"/>.

		Type = TBD14: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes left until reaching the license-customized route threshold. 
    This value is affected by whether a customized license exists for the relevant address family, and when the customized license is installed. 
    This value can increase or decrease based on current customized information of license.

	  <t>
		Since the license-customized route threshold is vendor specific, 
    this type value (TBD14) SHOULD use enterprise-specific TLV encoding as described in Section 3.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit"/>.
	  </t>

	  <t>
		For the enterprise-specific TLV of TBD14, E-bit SHOULD set to 1, and TBD14 is 15 bits of TLV Type. 
    As enterprise-specific Type value, TBD14 is determined by the Enterprise number, and does not have to be defined by INNA.

	<t>
		Type = TBD15: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI left until reaching the license-customized route threshold. 
    This value is affected by whether a customized license exists for the relevant address family, and when the customized license is installed.

    The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

	  <t>
    It's also since the license-customized route threshold is vendor specific,

	  </t>

	  <t>
		For the enterprise-specific TLV of TBD15, E-bit SHOULD set to 1, and TBD15 is 15 bits of TLV Type. 
    As enterprise-specific Type value, TBD15 is determined by the Enterprise number, and also does not have to be defined by INNA.

		Type = TBD16: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes rejected by exceeding the length threshold of as-path.

	<t>
		Type = TBD17: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI rejected by exceeding the length threshold of as-path.
