<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>
	<xref target="RFC7854"/> defines a number of different BMP statistics types to observe interesting events that occur on the router.
	Stats are either counters or gauges. A 32-bit Counter is a non-negative integer that monotonically increases
   until it reaches a maximum value, when it wraps around and starts increasing again from 0.
   A 64-bit Gauge is a non-negative integer that may increase or decrease, but shall never exceed a maximum value, nor fall below a minimum one.
</t>
<t>
   This document defines new gauges for BMP statistics message. The format of the BMP statistics message remains same as defined in <xref target="RFC7854"/>
</t>
