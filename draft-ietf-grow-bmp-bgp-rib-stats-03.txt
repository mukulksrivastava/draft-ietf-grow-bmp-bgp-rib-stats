1.  Introduction

   [RFC7854] defines a number of different BMP statistics types to
   observe interesting events that occur on the router.  Stats are
   either counters or gauges.  A 32-bit Counter is a non-negative
   integer that monotonically increases until it reaches a maximum
   value, when it wraps around and starts increasing again from 0.  A
   64-bit Gauge is a non-negative integer that may increase or decrease,
   but shall never exceed a maximum value, nor fall below a minimum one.

   This document defines new gauges for BMP statistics message.  The
   format of the BMP statistics message remains same as defined in
   [RFC7854].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Statistics Definition

   This section defines different statistics type for RIB-IN and RIB-OUT
   monitoring type.

2.1.  RIB-IN Statistics Definition

   *  Type = TBD1: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-
      In-Pre-Policy.  The value can increase or decrease based upon
      ongoing configuration change.  Note that this counter updates
      stats type 7 defined in [RFC7854] and makes it a explicit for Adj-
      RIBs-In-Pre-Policy.

   *  Type = TBD2: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-In-Pre-Policy.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change.  Note that this counter
      is similar from stats type 9 defined in [RFC7854] and makes it a
      explicit for Adj-RIBs-In-Pre-Policy.  The value is structured as:
      2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD3: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-
      In-Post-Policy.  The value can increase or decrease based upon
      ongoing configuration change.

   *  Type = TBD4: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-In-Post-Policy.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change.  The value is structured
      as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent
      Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD5: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI rejected by inbound policy.  The value can increase or
      decrease based upon ongoing configuration change.  Note that this
      counter is different from stats type 0 defined in [RFC7854].  The
      stats type 0 in [RFC7854] is the a 32 counter which is
      monotonically increasing number and doesn't represents the current
      number of routes rejected by inbound policy due to ongoing
      configuration changes.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD6: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      accepted by inbound policy.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change or network events.  The
      value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI),
      1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a
      64-bit Gauge.  Some implementations, or configurations in
      implementations, may discard routes that do not match policy and
      thus the accepted count and the rib-in counts will be identical in
      such cases.

   *  Type = TBD7: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      selected as primary route.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change or network events.  The
      value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI),
      1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a
      64-bit Gauge.  A primary path is a recursive or non-recursive path
      whose nexthop resolution ends with an adjacency
      draft-ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic].  A prefix can
      have more than one primary path if multipath is configured
      draft-lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations
      [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations].  A best-path is also
      considered as a primary path.

   *  Type = TBD8: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      selected as backup route.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change or network events.  The
      value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI),
      1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a
      64-bit Gauge.  A backup path is also installed in the RIB, but it
      is not used until some or all primary paths become unreachable.
      Backup paths are used for fast convergence in the event of
      failures.

   *  Type = TBD9: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      suppressed by configured route damping policy.  The value can
      increase or decrease based upon configuration change or network
      events.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  Suppressed refers to a path
      which has been declared suppressed by the BGP Route Flap Damping
      mechanism as described in Section 2.2 of [RFC2439].

   *  Type = TBD10: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      marked as stale by any configuration.  The value is structured as:
      2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  Stale
      refers to a path which has been declared stale by the BGP Graceful
      Restart mechanism as described in Section 4.1 of [RFC4724].

   *  Type = TBD11: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      marked as stale by LLGR.  The value is structured as: 2-byte
      Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  Stale refers to a
      path which has been declared stale by the BGP Long-Lived Graceful
      Restart mechanism as described in Section 4.3 of [RFC9494].  This
      is the route that are marked stale as part of LLGR process.

   *  Type = TBD12: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes left until reaching
      the received route threshold as defined in Section 6.7 of
      [RFC4271].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      configuration changes of the peer's received route threshold.

   *  Type = TBD13: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI left
      until reaching the received route threshold as defined in
      Section 6.7 of [RFC4271].  This value can increase or decrease
      base on ongoing configuration changes of the peer's received route
      threshold.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD14: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes rejected by
      reaching the license-customized route threshold.  This value is
      affected by whether a customized license exists for the relevant
      address family, and when the customized license is installed.
      This value can increase or decrease based on current customized
      information of license.

      Since the license-customized route threshold is vendor specific,
      this type value (TBD14) SHOULD use enterprise-specific TLV
      encoding as follows [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit]:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |E|       Stat Type             |          Stat Len             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                        Enterprise number                      |

      ~                                                               ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                  Figure 1

      For the enterprise-specific TLV of TBD14, E-bit SHOULD set to 1,
      and TBD14 is 15 bits of TLV Type.  As enterprise-specific Type
      value, TBD14 is determined by the Enterprise number, and does not
      have to be defined by INNA.

   *  Type = TBD15: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI rejected by reaching the license-customized route threshold.
      This value is affected by whether a customized license exists for
      the relevant address family, and when the customized license is
      installed.  This value can increase or decrease based on current
      customized information of license.  The value is structured as:
      2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

      It's also since the license-customized route threshold is vendor
      specific, this type value (TBD15) SHOULD use enterprise-specific
      TLV encoding as shown in Figure 1.

      For the enterprise-specific TLV of TBD15, E-bit SHOULD set to 1,
      and TBD15 is 15 bits of TLV Type.  As enterprise-specific Type
      value, TBD15 is determined by the Enterprise number, and also does
      not have to be defined by INNA.

   *  Type = TBD16: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes rejected by
      exceeding the length threshold of as-path.  This value can
      increase or decrease base on ongoing configuration changes of the
      length threshold of as-path.  For as-path attribute information,
      please refer to [RFC4271].

   *  Type = TBD17: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI rejected by exceeding the length threshold of as-path.  This
      value can increase or decrease base on ongoing configuration
      changes of the length threshold of as-path.  The value is
      structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte
      Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit
      Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD18: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-In-Post-Policy invalidated by verifying route origin
      Autonomous System (AS) number through the Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      ROA changes of RPKI.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD19: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-In-Post-Policy validated by verifying route origin
      Autonomous System (AS) number through the Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      ROA changes of RPKI.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD20: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-In-Post-Policy not found by verifying route origin
      Autonomous System (AS) number through the Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      ROA changes of RPKI.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

2.2.  RIB-OUT Statistics Definition

   *  Type = TBD21: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI rejected by outbound policy.  These routes are active routes
      which should otherwise would have been advertised in absense of
      outbound policy which rejected them.  The value can increase or
      decrease based upon ongoing configuration change.  The value is
      structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte
      Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit
      Gauge.  This counter only considers routes distributed from loc-
      rib into the adj-ribs-out and does not include cases like BGP add-
      paths [RFC7911].

   *  Type = TBD22: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes refused to
      be sent by exceeding the length threshold of as-path.  This value
      can increase or decrease base on ongoing configuration changes of
      the length threshold of as-path.  For as-path attribute
      information, please refer to [RFC4271].

   *  Type = TBD23: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI refused to be sent by exceeding the length threshold of as-
      path.  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      configuration changes of the length threshold of as-path.  The
      value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI),
      1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a
      64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD24: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-Out-Post-Policy invalidated by verifying route
      origin Autonomous System (AS) number through the Route Origin

      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      ROA changes of RPKI.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD25: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-Out-Post-Policy validated by verifying route origin
      Autonomous System (AS) number through the Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      ROA changes of RPKI.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD26: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-Out-Post-Policy not found by verifying route origin
      Autonomous System (AS) number through the Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      ROA changes of RPKI.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA assign the following new parameters
   (Except TBD14 and TBD15) to the BMP parameters name space
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/bmp-parameters/bmp-
   parameters.xhtml).

4.  Security Considerations

   The considerations in Section 11 of [RFC7854] apply to this document.
   It is also believed that this document does not add any additional
   security considerations.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Jeff Haas for his valuable input.
