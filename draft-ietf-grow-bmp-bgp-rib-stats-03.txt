1.  Introduction

   [RFC7854] defines a number of different BMP statistics types to
   observe interesting events that occur on the router.  Stats are
   either counters or gauges.  A 32-bit Counter is a non-negative
   integer that monotonically increases until it reaches a maximum
   value, when it wraps around and starts increasing again from 0.  A
   64-bit Gauge is a non-negative integer that may increase or decrease,
   but shall never exceed a maximum value, nor fall below a minimum one.

   This document defines new gauges for BMP statistics message.  The
   format of the BMP statistics message remains same as defined in
   [RFC7854].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Statistics Definition

   This section defines different statistics type for RIB-IN and RIB-OUT
   monitoring type.

2.1.  RIB-IN Statistics Definition

   *  Type = 18: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-In-
      Pre-Policy.  The value can increase or decrease based upon ongoing
      configuration change.  Note that this counter updates stats type 7
      defined in [RFC7854] and makes it a explicit for Adj-RIBs-In-Pre-
      Policy.

   *  Type = 19: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-In-Pre-Policy.  The value can increase or decrease based
      upon ongoing configuration change.  Note that this counter is
      similar from stats type 9 defined in [RFC7854] and makes it a
      explicit for Adj-RIBs-In-Pre-Policy.  The value is structured as:
      2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 20: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-In-
      Post-Policy.  The value can increase or decrease based upon
      ongoing configuration change.

   *  Type = 21: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-In-Post-Policy.  The value can increase or decrease based
      upon ongoing configuration change.  The value is structured as:
      2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 22: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      rejected by inbound policy.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change.  Note that this counter
      is different from stats type 0 defined in [RFC7854].  The stats
      type 0 in [RFC7854] is the a 32 counter which is monotonically
      increasing number and doesn't represents the current number of
      routes rejected by inbound policy due to ongoing configuration
      changes.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 23: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      accepted by inbound policy.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change or network events.  The
      value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI),
      1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a
      64-bit Gauge.  Some implementations, or configurations in
      implementations, may discard routes that do not match policy and
      thus the accepted count and the rib-in counts will be identical in
      such cases.

   *  Type = 24: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      selected as primary route.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change or network events.  The
      value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI),
      1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a
      64-bit Gauge.  A primary path is a recursive or non-recursive path
      whose nexthop resolution ends with an adjacency
      draft-ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic].  A prefix can
      have more than one primary path if multipath is configured
      draft-lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations
      [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations].  A best-path is also
      considered as a primary path.

   *  Type = 25: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      selected as backup route.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change or network events.  The
      value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI),
      1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a
      64-bit Gauge.  A backup path is also installed in the RIB, but it
      is not used until some or all primary paths become unreachable.
      Backup paths are used for fast convergence in the event of
      failures.

   *  Type = 26: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      suppressed by configured route damping policy.  The value can
      increase or decrease based upon configuration change or network
      events.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  Suppressed refers to a path
      which has been declared suppressed by the BGP Route Flap Damping
      mechanism as described in Section 2.2 of [RFC2439].

   *  Type = 27: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI marked
      as stale by any configuration.  The value is structured as: 2-byte
      Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  Stale refers to a
      path which has been declared stale by the BGP Graceful Restart
      mechanism as described in Section 4.1 of [RFC4724].

   *  Type = 28: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI marked
      as stale by LLGR.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  Stale refers to a
      path which has been declared stale by the BGP Long-Lived Graceful
      Restart mechanism as described in Section 4.3 of [RFC9494].  This
      is the route that are marked stale as part of LLGR process.

   *  Type = 29: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes left until reaching the
      received route threshold as defined in Section 6.7 of [RFC4271].
      This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing configuration
      changes of the peer's received route threshold.

   *  Type = 30: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI left
      until reaching the received route threshold as defined in
      Section 6.7 of [RFC4271].  This value can increase or decrease
      base on ongoing configuration changes of the peer's received route
      threshold.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 31: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes left until reaching the
      license-customized route threshold.  This value is affected by
      whether a customized license exists for the relevant address
      family, and when the customized license is installed.  This value
      can increase or decrease based on current customized information
      of license.

      Since the license-customized route threshold is vendor specific,
      this type value (31) SHOULD use enterprise-specific TLV encoding
      as described in Section 3.3 of [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].

      For the enterprise-specific TLV of 31, E-bit SHOULD set to 1, and
      31 is 15 bits of TLV Type.  As enterprise-specific Type value, 31
      is determined by the Enterprise number, and does not have to be
      defined by INNA.

   *  Type = 32: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI left
      until reaching the license-customized route threshold.  This value
      is affected by whether a customized license exists for the
      relevant address family, and when the customized license is
      installed.  This value can increase or decrease based on current
      customized information of license.  The value is structured as:
      2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

      It's also since the license-customized route threshold is vendor
      specific, this type value (32) SHOULD also use enterprise-specific
      TLV encoding as described in Section 3.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].

      For the enterprise-specific TLV of 32, E-bit SHOULD set to 1, and
      32 is 15 bits of TLV Type.  As enterprise-specific Type value, 32
      is determined by the Enterprise number, and also does not have to
      be defined by INNA.

   *  Type = 33: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes rejected by
      exceeding the length threshold of as-path.  This value can
      increase or decrease base on ongoing configuration changes of the
      length threshold of as-path.  For as-path attribute information,
      please refer to [RFC4271].

   *  Type = 34: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      rejected by exceeding the length threshold of as-path.  This value
      can increase or decrease base on ongoing configuration changes of
      the length threshold of as-path.  The value is structured as:
      2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 35: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI

      Autonomous System (AS) number through the Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      ROA changes of RPKI.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 36: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-In-Post-Policy validated by verifying route origin
      Autonomous System (AS) number through the Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      ROA changes of RPKI.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 37: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-In-Post-Policy not found by verifying route origin
      Autonomous System (AS) number through the Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This value can increase or decrease base on ongoing
      ROA changes of RPKI.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address
      Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family
      Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

2.2.  RIB-OUT Statistics Definition

   *  Type = 38: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      rejected by outbound policy.  These routes are active routes which
      should otherwise would have been advertised in absense of outbound
      policy which rejected them.  The value can increase or decrease
      based upon ongoing configuration change.  The value is structured
      as: 2-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent

      Address Family Identifier (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
      This counter only considers routes distributed from loc-rib into
      the adj-ribs-out and does not include cases like BGP add-paths
      [RFC7911].

   *  Type = 39: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes refused to be
